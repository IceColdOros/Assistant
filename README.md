Press a custom key on keyboard that pulls up a LLM or AI to ask questions with. Can include both text and voice options, if paired with an Alexa or something it’ll go hard. DB side tho? i want the app to keep the conversations between us and build characteristics around the conversations we have (anthropomorphism).

Click on key > pop up menu (almost like when you click the windows key) > has options to type text or to switch to voice (almost like WhatsApp) > get answer in text or voice (if you typed then you get text answer but will have option for voice answer, if questions was asked in voice get a voice reply but will have a transcript. Just like chat.)

Expectations of app:

Main purpose

An AI assistant that can be activated once a specific hot key is pressed. Once the app launches it should be a plain and simple text chat UI, blank and dark grey background while the opacity is at 0.7, or a completely transparent but blurred and a darker color. There should be text box and a voice icon right next to it, the chat will be recorder like on chat. A cool feature would be to run the voice toggle with its own hot key that will pop up a circle in a corner  representing the AI, once again like chat does in voice mode, while the chat is still opened in a text cheat but we cant see it, we just speak to it, almost like Jarvis.

Separate idea but can be implemented and be able to switch between views in AI popup window. A program that will allow me to select a specific application that currently running and allow me to map it to my wheel on the keyboard, so that i when i adjust the volume it will only adjust for the selected application. Basically the same as when you adjust the volume for applications like in Win 11 sound options, but now you select an applications that will be highlighted (set background color lighter) and only adjust its volume. The purpose being, when in game and the music is playing, you have to tab out and then adjust the volume where her you simply just turn the volume down.  

Target Points 

- Popup menu that appears when hotkey is pressed
- Menu should have text box and voice icon
- once a chat is started it will be displayed
- can be activated whenever (should not be obstructive)

Side Note

i want the engine/LLM/AI to be a google AI assistant in a way, as in sometimes i want is to show me a place on a map or google earth, “hey *AI name* please show me where France is” AI then searches for France on google earth and will show me in the popup window. But for research like example, “please help me fix this bug in my code” then i want the AI to help me as chat would through voice. So essentially i want it to be an AI that has access to basically everything (earth, Spotify, etc.) and will show me the thing i want to see on the applications i want to see them (a place = earth) while keeping it simple, clean and minimalistic. Maybe in the future i connect it to a Alexa and completely host it separately on a raspberry pi.
